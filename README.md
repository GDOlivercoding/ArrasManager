# ArrasManager
repo for the files of my own arras.io save manager, documentation is not available, dm me on discord: celestial_raccoon_80621

arras.py is the main application
installer.py is the obviously installer (run when downloading)
modify.py is the settings app for the main app (run whenever, contains some sort of docs)
init.py is a system file containing all imports and data from all others

dependencies can be found in requirements.txt

extractor.py is an independent app used to extract data from any code given
runs without any need of libraries or other files

installer.py can be used to repair potentially damaged files
if a bug occurs please dm me on discord on top of this document

do `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` upon download
or just `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you have pip on your PATH

to download dependecies you can also run the `requirements.py` file which 
will download all the dependecies for you :)
